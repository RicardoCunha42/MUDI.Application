# MUDI.Application-API-Rest
API Rest java project made at Alura's Spring MVC courses. It's an application that register products and offers on them in a databank, and follows the MVC pattern. It's view layer is made with thymeleaf as well as Vue.js. 

#New feature
After the course, I added a register feature that allows the creation of users through the browser.

#How to use it
One can use it by simply downloading the files and running it on any IDE after configuring the databank settings on the application.properties file. It receives http requests and has a view layer so one can interact with it at the browser.

#Next goal:

Show, to each user, the offers made on their products.
