# MUDI.Application-API-Rest
API Rest java project made at Alura's Spring MVC courses. It's an application that register products and offers on them in a databank, and follows the MVC pattern. It's view layer is made with thymeleaf as well as Vue.js. 

One can use it by simply downloading the files and run it on any IDE or by the command line after configuring the databank settings on the application.properties file. It receives http requests and has a view so one can interact with it at the browser. The user is still created on the WebSecurityConfig class, and currently sports the username "geralt" and password "123".

#Next goal:

Allow the creation of users through the application view.
